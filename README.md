Zero shot learning for common sense via knowledge graphs

Task0:
Read COMET, KagNet, DecaNLPM, Multi-task models

Task1:
Use DecaNLP, figure out the data loaders and how to train models on it
Train a BERT based model on QA (SQUAD), Zero Shot Relation Extraction (QA-ZRE) and Sentiment Analysis (SST) as multi-task (by combining: atleast setting up) and also individual task models

Task2:
Setting up COMET or KagNet, etc and created a common sense QA model for this

Task3:
Using this common sense model to perform zero shot

Task4:
Using this common sense model to do transfer learning, knowledge distillation and lifelong learning
